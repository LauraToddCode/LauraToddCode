Hi, I'm Laura and I'm a self-taught developer. I've been coding since 2019 and mainly work in CSS, JavaScript and React. I'm looking for my first tech role but in the meantime I'm learning as much as I can and pushing myself to create better and better projects.

## Take a look at my portfolio page:
